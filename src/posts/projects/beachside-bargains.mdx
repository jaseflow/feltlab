  Beachside Bargains Ballina are in a unique 
  situation where there are two other stores 
  with the same name just a town away. 
  Therefore it was important that they got a

## Beachside vibes for Beachside Bargains
Beachside Bargains already had a good looking logo to work with that allowed us to seamlessly integrate a beachy vibe with bold and vibrant colours. As you scroll on both mobile and desktop it transitions the sky from a sunny blue horizon into a beautiful orange sunset, while the logo sets in the background. Gorgeous!

With it’s mobile-first design, the call to actions are positioned perfectly near those eager thumbs. A mobile-first responsive design is always going to deliver the best results when scaling the design up to larger devices.

## Clever integration with native apps
You don’t need to spend big to get the most out of a mobile web experience. Google Maps allows you to copy a URL for directions from any point. If you are on your phone, Google Maps will prompt you to open the link in the app and you can switch to the native Google Maps for a better navigation experience.

See in the examples below the user flow between the website and a native Google Maps.

## Instagram feed
The great thing about having an Instagram feed on your page is you can spend all your time curating your feed in the Instagram app and reap all the rewards for your website.

It is even possible to set the Instagram feed to show photos from a particular post. This way you can set specific content themes to show during in store sales.
