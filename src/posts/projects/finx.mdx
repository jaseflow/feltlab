## Requirements
FinX is a finance solutions company that offers financial services to customers looking to purchase vehicles, equipment, marine, caravans and other commercial goods.

At the time FinX did not have a website to direct potential customers to and therefor needed one built, asap.

The primary goal of this new website will be to generate leads as well as provide an online presence

## Responsive website
The new landing page is a ‘responsive’ website. This means that the user interface responds to the device size it is being viewed on and fits to screen accordingly.

The design of this website will take a ‘single page’ approach. This is exactly the same as any other website, it just means that instead of creating multiple pages that are bare with content on them, you design the landing page to include all the content for the website and be supported by a navigation system that allows the user to jump to the relevant sections. This creates a more engaging experience by allowing your content to be discovered by scrolls rather than clicks to subsequent pages.

## Loan repayment calculator
This primary features of the new website will be a loan calculator tool that allows the customer to enter their desired loan amount, configure a loan duration and then preview the repayments. From there they will be able to send an enquiry through to the FinX team who will receive their contact details along with the selected loan terms.

## Enquiry form
The second part to the loan calculator is the enquiry form. Once the desired loan terms are entered in the calculator, the user will be asked to enter contact information including name, email address, phone number as well as employment status.o

## Mobile workflow
This design was created from a mobile first approach, this is evident when you see the animations between the form steps.
